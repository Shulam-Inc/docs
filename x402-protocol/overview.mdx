# x402 Protocol Overview

The [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/) is an open standard by Coinbase that enables internet-native payments using the HTTP 402 status code.

## What is x402?

HTTP 402 ("Payment Required") has been reserved since 1999 but never had a standard implementation. The x402 protocol defines how to:

1. Request payment via HTTP 402 responses
2. Sign payment authorizations off-chain (no gas for the buyer)
3. Submit payments via HTTP headers
4. Settle payments on-chain through a facilitator

## How It Works

```
┌──────────┐         ┌──────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────┐
│  Client  │────1───▶│  Server  │         │  Facilitator │         │   Chain  │

└──────────┘         └──────────┘         └──────────────┘         └──────────┘
```

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Client requests a paid resource |
| 2 | Server returns HTTP 402 with payment details (amount, token, network) |
| 3 | Client signs an EIP-3009 authorization and resubmits with `X-PAYMENT` header |
| 4 | Server forwards the payment to the facilitator for verification |
| 5 | Facilitator settles the USDC transfer on-chain |
| 6 | Server grants access to the resource |

## Key Properties

- **Gasless for buyers** — signing an authorization costs nothing
- **Stablecoin-based** — payments in USDC, not volatile crypto
- **HTTP-native** — works with existing HTTP infrastructure
- **Open standard** — any facilitator can implement it
- **Chain-agnostic** — designed for multi-chain support (Base, Ethereum, etc.)

## The 402 Response

When a server requires payment, it returns:

```http
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
X-PAYMENT-DETAILS: {
  "scheme": "exact",
  "network": "base",
  "token": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
  "amount": "10000000",
  "recipient": "0xMerchantAddress",
  "facilitator": "https://api.shulam.io"
}
```

## The Payment Header

The client signs an authorization and includes it in the request:

```http
POST /api/premium-content HTTP/1.1
X-PAYMENT: eyJ0eXBlIjoiZXhhY3QiLCJuZXR3b3JrIjoiYmFzZSIsInBheWxvYWQiOi...
```

The `X-PAYMENT` header contains a base64url-encoded JSON object with:
- The EIP-3009 transfer authorization
- The EIP-712 signature
- The network identifier

## x402 V2

The V2 specification (2025) adds support for:
- Multiple facilitator selection
- Enhanced compliance metadata
- Subscription payment patterns
- Cross-chain settlement
