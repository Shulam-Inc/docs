## Common Issues

### "Invalid signature" on verification

- Ensure the buyer signed with the correct wallet and chain
- Check that the USDC contract address matches the network
- Verify the EIP-712 domain parameters match USDC's contract

### "Nonce already used" on settlement

- Each payment authorization can only be used once
- If you see this error, the payment was already settled
- Generate a new authorization for a new payment

### Webhook not receiving events

- Verify your endpoint is publicly accessible (not localhost)
- Check that you registered the correct event types
- Ensure your endpoint returns HTTP 200 within 30 seconds
- Check webhook delivery logs in your dashboard

### "Insufficient balance" on settlement

- The buyer's USDC balance may have changed between signing and settlement
- Settle quickly after the buyer signs to minimize this risk
