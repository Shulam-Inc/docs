# FAQ

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Shulam?">
    Shulam is the compliance layer for AI agent payments on Base. Built on Coinbase's x402 protocol, Shulam lets merchants accept USDC stablecoin payments with OFAC screening, trust scoring, and audit trails built in — at just 5 basis points per settlement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Shulam different from Stripe?">
    Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Shulam charges 5 basis points (0.05%) with compliance included. Payments settle in seconds instead of days, and there are no chargebacks — disputes are handled via smart contract escrow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the fees?">
    Shulam charges 5 basis points (0.05%) per settlement — a fraction of traditional payment processing fees. This includes OFAC screening, trust scoring, and compliance audit trails. Gas costs on Base L2 are fractions of a cent.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What networks are supported?">
    Base Mainnet (production) and Base Sepolia (testnet). Additional chains are planned.

## Payments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What currency are payments in?">
    All payments are in USDC, a regulated stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. No volatile cryptocurrencies are involved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fast do payments settle?">
    Direct payments settle in 2-5 seconds on Base L2. Escrow payments are held until explicitly released.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can payments be reversed?">
    Direct payments are final once settled on-chain. Escrow payments can be refunded before release. There is no equivalent of credit card chargebacks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do buyers need to own cryptocurrency?">
    Buyers need USDC in their wallet. They can acquire USDC through Coinbase, Circle, or other on-ramps. No ETH is needed — signing is gasless.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported?">
    Any EIP-1193 compatible wallet: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect-compatible wallets, and hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Escrow & Disputes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does escrow work?">
    Deferred payments deposit USDC into the ShulamEscrow smart contract. Funds are released to the merchant when conditions are met, or refunded to the buyer if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are disputes handled?">
    Buyers can open disputes within 14 days. Merchants have 7 days to respond with evidence. An admin resolves the dispute, or it auto-resolves in the buyer's favor after 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is cashback?">
    Buyers earn USDC cashback on every purchase (default 0.25% of payment value). Cashback accumulates in the CashbackVault contract and can be withdrawn when the balance exceeds 1 USDC.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is EIP-3009?">
    EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization) allows gasless USDC transfers. The buyer signs an off-chain message, and a relayer submits the transaction. See the [EIP-3009 explainer](/x402-protocol/eip-3009).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the facilitator custodial?">
    No. The facilitator never holds buyer or merchant funds. USDC moves directly from the buyer's wallet to the merchant (or escrow contract) via the USDC smart contract.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the facilitator goes down?">
    Existing escrow funds remain safely in the smart contract. They can be released or refunded through direct contract interaction. New payments would need to wait for the facilitator to recover.
  </Accordion>
