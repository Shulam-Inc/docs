# FAQ

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Shulam?">
    Shulam is a payment processing platform that lets merchants accept USDC stablecoin payments over HTTP with zero processing fees. It's built on Coinbase's x402 protocol and settles payments on Base L2.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Shulam different from Stripe?">
    Stripe charges 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. Shulam charges 0%. Payments settle in seconds instead of days, and there are no chargebacks — disputes are handled via smart contract escrow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the fees?">
    Zero merchant processing fees. Buyers pay minimal gas costs on Base L2 (fractions of a cent), which are covered by the facilitator in most cases.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What networks are supported?">
    Base Mainnet (production) and Base Sepolia (testnet). Additional chains are planned.
  </Accordion>

## Payments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What currency are payments in?">
    All payments are in USDC, a regulated stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. No volatile cryptocurrencies are involved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fast do payments settle?">
    Direct payments settle in 2-5 seconds on Base L2. Escrow payments are held until explicitly released.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can payments be reversed?">
    Direct payments are final once settled on-chain. Escrow payments can be refunded before release. There is no equivalent of credit card chargebacks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do buyers need to own cryptocurrency?">
    Buyers need USDC in their wallet. They can acquire USDC through Coinbase, Circle, or other on-ramps. No ETH is needed — signing is gasless.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallets are supported?">
    Any EIP-1193 compatible wallet: MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect-compatible wallets, and hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Escrow & Disputes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does escrow work?">
    Deferred payments deposit USDC into the ShulamEscrow smart contract. Funds are released to the merchant when conditions are met, or refunded to the buyer if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are disputes handled?">
    Buyers can open disputes within 14 days. Merchants have 7 days to respond with evidence. An admin resolves the dispute, or it auto-resolves in the buyer's favor after 30 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is cashback?">
    Buyers earn USDC cashback on every purchase (default 0.25% of payment value). Cashback accumulates in the CashbackVault contract and can be withdrawn when the balance exceeds 1 USDC.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is EIP-3009?">
    EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization) allows gasless USDC transfers. The buyer signs an off-chain message, and a relayer submits the transaction. See the [EIP-3009 explainer](/x402-protocol/eip-3009).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the facilitator custodial?">
    No. The facilitator never holds buyer or merchant funds. USDC moves directly from the buyer's wallet to the merchant (or escrow contract) via the USDC smart contract.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if the facilitator goes down?">
    Existing escrow funds remain safely in the smart contract. They can be released or refunded through direct contract interaction. New payments would need to wait for the facilitator to recover.
  </Accordion>
