# Account Setup

## Create a Merchant Account

1. Visit [app.shulam.io](https://app.shulam.io) and click **Sign Up**
2. Provide your business details (name, website, business type)
3. Complete KYB (Know Your Business) verification
4. Set your receiving wallet address (any EVM-compatible wallet)

<Warning>
Your receiving wallet must be able to accept USDC on Base. Make sure you're not using a CEX deposit address that doesn't support Base L2.
</Warning>

## Generate API Keys

After account verification, generate your API credentials:

1. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
2. Click **Create New Key**
3. Choose your environment:
   - **Test** — for Base Sepolia testnet
   - **Live** — for Base Mainnet production

Your API key will look like:
```
Test: sk_test_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
Live: sk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

<Warning>
Store your API key securely. Never expose it in client-side code or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Environment Configuration

Set up your environment variables:

```bash .env
# Shulam API
SHULAM_API_KEY=sk_test_...
SHULAM_API_URL=https://api.shulam.io

# Your wallet
MERCHANT_WALLET=0xYourWalletAddress

# Webhooks (optional)
SHULAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Configure Webhooks

Register a webhook endpoint to receive real-time payment events:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.shulam.io/webhooks/configure \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://yoursite.com/webhooks/shulam",
    "events": [
      "payment.completed",
      "payment.failed",
      "escrow.deposited",
      "escrow.released",
      "escrow.refunded",
      "cashback.credited"
    ],
    "secret": "whsec_your_secret"
  }'
```

See the [Webhooks Guide](/guides/webhooks) for details on event types and signature verification.

## Test Your Setup

Verify your integration is working:

```bash
# Check API connectivity
curl https://api.shulam.io/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_..."

# Expected response:
# { "status": "ok", "service": "shulam-facilitator" }
```

## Going Live

When you're ready to accept real payments:

1. Switch from `sk_test_` to `sk_live_` API keys
2. Update your facilitator URL if using a custom domain
3. Ensure your wallet is on Base Mainnet
4. Configure production webhook endpoints
5. Test with a small real payment before launching

<Info>
No code changes are needed between testnet and mainnet — just swap the API key and wallet addresses.
