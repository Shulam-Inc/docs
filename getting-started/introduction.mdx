# Welcome to Shulam

Shulam is the compliance layer for AI agent payments on Base. Built on the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/), Shulam enables merchants to accept USDC stablecoin payments over HTTP with built-in OFAC screening, trust scoring, and audit trails — at just 5 basis points per settlement.

## Why Shulam?

## How It Works

Shulam acts as a **facilitator** in the x402 payment flow. When a buyer makes a payment:

1. The buyer signs an EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` off-chain
2. Shulam verifies the signature and compliance checks
3. The payment is settled on Base L2 (or escrowed for deferred payments)
4. The merchant receives USDC directly to their wallet
5. The buyer earns cashback automatically

```
Buyer → signs authorization → Shulam Facilitator → settles on-chain → Merchant
                                      ↓
                              OFAC/KYT screening
                              Cashback distribution
                              Webhook notifications
```
